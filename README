= mwrap - LD_PRELOAD malloc wrapper + line stats for Ruby

Wraps all malloc, calloc, and realloc calls to trace the Ruby source
location of such calls and bytes allocated at each callsite.  This
functionality may change incompatibly or be expanded in the future.

This is useful for finding malloc hotspots in Ruby code.  It does
not track allocation lifetimes, or frees, however.

Only supports Ruby trunk (2.6.0dev+) a few platforms:

* GNU/Linux
* FreeBSD 11

== Usage

It works as an LD_PRELOAD and supplies a mwrap RubyGem executable to
improve ease-of-use.  You can set dump_fd: in the MWRAP environment
variable to dump the results to a certain file descriptor at exit:

	MWRAP=dump_fd:2 mwrap RUBY_COMMAND

You may also set dump_path to append to a log file:

	MWRAP=dump_path:/path/to/log mwrap RUBY_COMMAND

You may also `require 'mwrap'' in your Ruby code and use
Mwrap.dump and Mwrap.clear.

== Known problems

* 32-bit machines are prone to overflow (WONTFIX)

* Allocations outside of GVL are not tracked (TODO)
